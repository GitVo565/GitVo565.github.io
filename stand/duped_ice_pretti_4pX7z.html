        <h1>Don't Get Duped: ICE and Alex Pretti Incident</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Deep dive into the facts behind the Alex Jeffrey Pretti shooting by federal agents. Media often omits key details to push anti-enforcement narratives. Here's the truth to arm yourself against misinformation, focusing on counterpoints to mainstream drivel.</p>
        
        <h2>Truth Files: Incident Analysis</h2>
        <p>The details about Alex Jeffrey Pretti’s firearm align with reports from multiple sources, including official DHS releases and analyses from gun experts and conservative outlets. Pretti was legally carrying a SIG Sauer P320 AXG Combat, a striker-fired 9mm pistol known for its modular design and popularity among law enforcement and enthusiasts. <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/us-news/alex-prettis-sig-p320-may-have-gone-off-accidentally-experts-suggest">[NY Post]</a> <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/not-a-cheap-piece-of-crap-gun-reportedly-carried-by-alex-pretti-is-widely-popular/article_9ffd6971-ba51-4137-a29d-f7ec9aa7ba2c.html">[Union Leader]</a> <a href="https://www.startribune.com/not-a-cheap-piece-of-crap-gun-reportedly-carried-by-alex-pretti-is-widely-popular-among-enthusiasts/601570176">[Star Tribune]</a> This model features a threaded barrel (typically 4.6” or 4.7” carbon steel with 1/2x28 threading for suppressors), an optic-ready slide (compatible with red-dot sights like the SIG Romeo series), suppressor-height XRAY3 night sights, and an FDE anodized AXG alloy grip module for enhanced control. <a href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/new-video-adds-context-death-of-alex-pretti.html">[Military.com]</a> <a href="https://www.startribune.com/not-a-cheap-piece-of-crap-gun-reportedly-carried-by-alex-pretti-is-widely-popular-among-enthusiasts/601570176">[Star Tribune]</a> It ships standard with three extended 21-round magazines, making it high-capacity by design, and the setup retails for around $1,100–$1,300 base, though customized versions with optics and accessories can push $1,500–$2,000. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a> <a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/crime/not-a-cheap-piece-of-crap-gun-reportedly-carried-by-alex-pretti-is-widely-popular/article_9ffd6971-ba51-4137-a29d-f7ec9aa7ba2c.html">[Union Leader]</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/us-news/alex-prettis-sig-p320-may-have-gone-off-accidentally-experts-suggest">[NY Post]</a> Pretti’s pistol was fully loaded with one such magazine at the time, and DHS released photos confirming these specs, emphasizing it wasn’t a basic or inexpensive carry piece but a premium, purpose-built firearm. <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/us-news/alex-prettis-sig-p320-may-have-gone-off-accidentally-experts-suggest">[NY Post]</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a></p>
        
        <p>Mainstream media coverage has indeed downplayed or omitted these firearm specifics, often framing Pretti simply as “armed” without context on the gun’s capabilities or cost, which could imply intent or preparedness beyond casual carry. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-ice">[NY Times]</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-federal-officers-fired-guns-alex-pretti-shooting-dhs-report-rcna256274">[NBC News]</a> <a href="https://abc7.com/post/dhs-report-says-2-agents-fired-weapons-alex-pretti-shooting/18487676">[ABC7]</a> Conservative commentators and gun rights advocates argue this omission fuels narratives of excessive force while ignoring factors like the P320’s documented history of unintentional discharges—over 100 lawsuits allege “uncommanded” firings due to design flaws, including drop-fire issues addressed in a 2017 voluntary upgrade program. <a href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/new-video-adds-context-death-of-alex-pretti.html">[Military.com]</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-probes-whether-agents-killed-va-nurse-accidental-discharge-minneapolis-ice-raid">[Fox News]</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/us-news/dhs-investigating-whether-alex-prettis-gun-accidentally-fired-and-sparked-deadly-minneapolis-shooting-sources">[NY Post]</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a> DHS is actively investigating whether Pretti’s gun accidentally discharged during the struggle (possibly when an agent removed it from his waistband), which may have been perceived as hostile fire, prompting the agents’ response. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-probes-whether-agents-killed-va-nurse-accidental-discharge-minneapolis-ice-raid">[Fox News]</a> <a href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/new-video-adds-context-death-of-alex-pretti.html">[Military.com]</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a> Gun expert Rob Doar, in a breakdown, suggested the initial shot heard in videos could have been a negligent or accidental discharge from the seized weapon, escalating the chaos. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a></p>
        
        <p>On the legal front, the analysis tracks with established precedents under Graham v. Connor (1989), where use of force is judged by objective reasonableness based on the circumstances known to officers at the time—not hindsight or freeze-frame video. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-federal-officers-fired-guns-alex-pretti-shooting-dhs-report-rcna256274">[NBC News]</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/27/alex-pretti-dhs-cbp-report/88386166007">[USA Today]</a> In a dynamic melee with an armed, resisting individual amid protests (where Pretti had prior aggressive encounters with agents, including property damage 11 days earlier), the shout of “gun” creates a reasonable fear of imminent harm. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-probes-whether-agents-killed-va-nurse-accidental-discharge-minneapolis-ice-raid">[Fox News]</a> <a href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/new-video-adds-context-death-of-alex-pretti.html">[Military.com]</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a> Officers aren’t required to verify threats personally or wait for a shot to be fired; they can rely on collective knowledge and perceptions from the team. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-federal-officers-fired-guns-alex-pretti-shooting-dhs-report-rcna256274">[NBC News]</a> Legal analysts from outlets like Law Officer and American Thinker describe the incident as tragic but likely justified, given the active resistance, presence of a high-end firearm, and potential for accidental discharge in a “dogpile” struggle. <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/25/us-news/alex-prettis-sig-p320-may-have-gone-off-accidentally-experts-suggest">[NY Post]</a> <a href="https://abc7.com/post/dhs-report-says-2-agents-fired-weapons-alex-pretti-shooting/18487676">[ABC7]</a> Ongoing probes by DHS, CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, and a federal judge’s order preserving evidence (including against destruction by the Trump administration) may clarify more, but based on current substantiation, the use of force appears defensible under self-defense standards. <a href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/new-video-adds-context-death-of-alex-pretti.html">[Military.com]</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ABC30/posts/new-details-union-officials-said-the-man-killed-by-a-us-border-patrol-officer-in/1326393189518634">[ABC30 Facebook]</a></p>
        
        <h2>Full Recap of the Incident</h2>
        <p>On January 24, 2026, around 9 a.m. local time, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and ICU nurse, was fatally shot by two U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents—one Border Patrol agent firing a Glock 19 and one CBP officer firing a Glock 47—for a total of approximately 10 shots during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis's Whittier neighborhood near 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue. The operation targeted an undocumented immigrant with a criminal history, but chaotic protests disrupted it, allowing the target to escape and injuring one agent. Bystander videos show Pretti filming agents with his phone while intervening to help a woman pushed to the ground during clashes; he was not holding a gun but had one holstered in his waistband—a high-end SIG Sauer P320 AXG Combat, a striker-fired 9mm pistol with a 4.6-inch threaded barrel (1/2x28 for suppressors), optic-ready slide (compatible with SIG Romeo optics), suppressor-height XRAY3 night sights, FDE anodized AXG alloy grip module, and equipped with extended 21-round magazines, a premium setup costing $1,500–$2,000, far from a basic or cheap carry gun. Agents pepper-sprayed him at close range, struck him, tackled him, and restrained him on the icy ground; one agent removed and secured his gun before shouts of "He's got a gun!" led to the shooting while Pretti was pinned amid a physical struggle with an armed suspect where the gun was perceived and the word “gun” was shouted. DHS initially claimed Pretti approached armed, "violently resisted" disarmament, and posed an imminent threat, justifying "defensive shots," with officials like Stephen Miller labeling him a "domestic terrorist" or "would-be assassin." However, a preliminary DHS report to Congress omitted any mention of Pretti brandishing or drawing the gun, noting only the shout and five-second delay before firing, and videos contradict key elements of the official narrative. Under settled self-defense law, officers are entitled to rely on fellow officers’ reasonable perceptions without personally confirming the threat; once a firearm appears during active resistance, the legal standard is reasonable perception of imminent deadly force, which some analyses argue was met here, as freeze-frame activism doesn’t override real-time dynamics, and the law does not require officers to wait to be shot—making this a tragic but potentially lawful use of force. Investigations by DHS, CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, and the FBI are ongoing, with bodycam footage under review but not released; the agents are on administrative leave. This was the second fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis that month amid Trump's immigration crackdown, following Renee Good's death on January 7.</p>
        
        <h2>Background on Alex Jeffrey Pretti</h2>
        <p>Pretti was born November 9, 1988, in Park Ridge, Illinois, to parents Michael and Susan Pretti, with northern Italian ancestry. He grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, graduating from Preble High School in 2006, where he played football, baseball, ran track, participated in show choir, musicals, was a Boy Scout, and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He attended the University of Minnesota, earning a bachelor's in biology, society, and environment in 2011, and obtained a nursing license in 2021. Pretti lived in Minneapolis's Lyndale neighborhood, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hiking, mountain biking, and time with his dog, and had no criminal record beyond minor traffic tickets. Colleagues and patients described him as compassionate, humorous, and dedicated to veterans' care at the VA hospital, though he had reportedly quit or been placed on leave amid escalating involvement in protests against the immigration operations, which his family had expressed concerns about, viewing his deepening activism as erratic or unstable behavior. He was upset by the immigration crackdown and Renee Good's death, participating in protests, and his parents warned him to be careful, reportedly knowing he could be seen as a "nut" for his intense opposition.</p>
        
        <h2>Media Manipulation of Pretti's Photos</h2>
        <p>Mainstream and social media have spread manipulated images, including AI-enhanced or altered photos falsely showing Pretti brandishing a gun (when he held a phone), headless agents in scenes, or miscaptioned collages misidentifying him with images of other men in drag or shirtless at festivals from unrelated accounts. For example, an X post by @MarioNawfal highlighted how Pretti’s photo was AI-face-tuned to appear more sympathetic, with the edited image aired on MSNBC and displayed at a memorial during a New York Sirens vs. Minnesota Frost hockey game, suggesting manipulation to garner sympathy and popularity by making "reality camera-ready." These gathered millions of views, distorting public opinion and fueling false narratives, similar to manipulations after Renee Good's killing. Fact-checkers like Reuters and BBC debunked them as miscaptioned or AI-altered, introducing inaccuracies like facial changes or non-existent details. MSNBC aired an AI-manipulated photo on "Deadline: White House" (TV, YouTube, website), later correcting only the YouTube version; an MS NOW spokesperson admitted using it unknowingly.</p>
        
        <h2>Media Downplaying the Gun at the Scene</h2>
        <p>Outlets like CNN, MSNBC, NPR, PBS, and The Washington Post have downplayed or hidden the firearm's high-end details—like its threaded barrel, extended magazines, and optic-ready setup—that could imply preparedness beyond casual carry. Coverage frames the gun's presence as irrelevant, criticizing Trump officials for using it to justify the shooting and sparking Second Amendment backlash from gun rights groups, but often omitting specifics on the gun's capabilities or cost that conservative commentators argue the media is hiding to fuel excessive force narratives. A DHS report omitted brandishing, noting only the shout; this downplays the gun by highlighting "fog-of-war" while arguing videos show no justification for lethal force.</p>
        
        <h2>Examples of Poor Coverage from CNN or MSNBC vs. the Truth</h2>
        <p>CNN and MSNBC coverage has included factual errors, biased framing, and reliance on manipulated content. For instance, MSNBC's "Deadline: White House" broadcast an AI-altered photo of the scene (hallucinating details like a clearer gun or distorted figures), used on TV, YouTube, and website, correcting only YouTube after fact-checkers exposed it as synthesized from low-quality video—truth: Original videos show no gun in hand, confirmed by forensics. CNN aired a Trump supporter claiming Pretti "was obviously not murdered" but in a "scrum that ended in a bad shoot," downplaying videos showing restraint before firing—truth: Analysis by Bellingcat and outlets confirms disarming prior, no threat. MSNBC host on CNN called ICE operations "lunacy," framing as overreach without noting Pretti's prior aggressive acts—truth: Videos show him interfering, spitting, damaging vehicles. CNN's interview with witnesses focused on outrage without context of Pretti's history—truth: He had confronted agents violently 11 days prior. Overall, coverage emphasizes "excessive force" narrative, omitting or minimizing Pretti's role in escalation and the gun's premium details vs. facts of his interference and the firearm's significance in real-time threat perception.</p>
        
        <h2>Pretti's Record of Law Enforcement Interference and Violent Behavior</h2>
        <p>Eleven days prior, on January 13, 2026, videos show Pretti confronting federal agents during protests: he shouted expletives, spat at them, dared them to assault him, kicked out a government SUV's taillight (causing damage), flashed middle fingers, and was tackled, reporting a broken rib but not arrested—described as erratic, violent, and indicative of militant agitation. For example, an X post by @saras76 shared a clip from Fox News' Greg Gutfeld discussing this footage, with a chyron reading "VIDEO SHOWS PRETTI SPIT AT AGENTS, KICK VEHICLE," portraying it as part of a pattern of reckless behavior where Pretti escalated from verbal aggression to physical damage, with commenters noting it showed him as "unhinged" and potentially escalating to carrying a firearm illegally without ID. Legal experts note this history suggests a pattern of interference with operations, potentially warranting charges for assault on officers or property damage, though unprosecuted due to local environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Takeaways to Avoid Being Duped</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Media often omits firearm details to paint agents as overreacting—remember, Pretti's gun was premium and had known discharge issues.</li>
            <li>Legal standards like Graham v. Connor focus on real-time perceptions, not edited videos.</li>
            <li>Question narratives pushing "excessive force" without full context on resistance, prior aggression, and accidental discharge risks.</li>
            <li>Cross-check with conservative and expert sources for balanced views, as mainstream outlets downplay counterpoints like Pretti's violent history and the gun's significance.</li>
