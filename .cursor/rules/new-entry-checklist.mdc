# New Sunday Journal Entry — Checklist

When adding a new Sunday Journal installment, follow this order so the site is current before the email goes out.

## Order of operations

1. **Create the entry file** — Add or update the HTML for the new journal entry on the site (e.g. archive or entry-specific page).
2. **Update the vault index** — Update `vault-7f3e9a1b.html` (Crew Vault) so it lists the new entry and links to it. The email’s plain-text fallback links to the vault; subscribers must see the new content there.
3. **Then send the Sunday Journal** — Run the Apps Script (Test Send → Send). The email body contains the full journal text; the vault link is for plain-text clients only. Do not send before steps 1 and 2 are live.

## Why this order

If you send the email first and update the vault later, a subscriber who clicks “Read the entry in the vault” may see last week’s content. Updating the vault and entry **before** (or at the same time as) sending avoids that.

## Sheet-side prep (manual)

Before sending, ensure: Form_Responses has **Status** in F1; the **Draft** tab exists with A1 = subject, A2 = body paragraphs only. See **Venture/000-VENTURE_NOTES.md** → “Sunday Journal — Deployment Checklist.”
