# Private Folders — Never Push to Git

Never suggest, stage, or commit any files from these folders. They are intentionally excluded from version control.

## Protected Folders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Venture/** | Private planning docs; master operations manual |
| **WorkingArea/** | Scratch space for MD files, drafts, and working notes |

## Rules

1. **Do not** add these paths to `git add` or include them in commit suggestions
2. **Do not** remove or modify `.gitignore` entries for `Venture/` or `WorkingArea/`
3. If asked to stage or commit "all" files, explicitly exclude these folders
4. If the user is editing files in these folders, treat them as private — never push to Git
