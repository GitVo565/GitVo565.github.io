Voetberg EventsDaniel Voetberg+12 others+4 othersHi Family!Rather than send long emails, I've developed a website that you can look at to see the happenings around our household and add items directly to your calendar if you would like to attend!  But always stay tuned / and reach out to me so I can keep you updated in case something changes with something you plan to attend!Our Events - https://gitvo565.github.io/events_7x9B2.htmlRecap - https://gitvo565.github.io/history_8kL9m.htmlBeyond that, we are hunkered down here trying to stay warm and watching to see what event(s) might be impacted by the cold (last Friday's meet was cancelled already).   Tacie is busy planning her next year's classes, Donald enters his final semester as a high schooler, Brian is pulling down 19 credits in his 2nd semester JR year at Butler!, and Tonya just accepted a new position within Kimberly-Clark that she had been trying for for some time!Take care all, look forward to hearing from you, and thanks again for all the kid support!Tacie's Wrestling Debut - Battle by the River Wrestling (Saturday Jan 17)Daniel Voetberg+12 others+4 othersDear Family,I hope this email finds you well! If you're interested in attending the upcoming Battle by the River Middle School Wrestling Duals to support Tacie and the Stevens Point Middle School team, here is the information you need.Event DetailsDate: Saturday, January 17, 2026Location: Former East Junior High - Address: 311 Lincoln St., Wisconsin Rapids, WI 54494Link for Directions:  https://maps.app.goo.gl/qierUUzyc9o3vEEi8Schedule:Start Time: Wrestling is scheduled to begin around 9:00 AM - 9:30AMArrival: I recommend spectators arrive around 8:45 AM to find a seat before the action starts.Duration: The event typically runs until late afternoonFormat This is a "duals" event (team vs. team), so Tacie will likely wrestle 3-5 matches throughout the day with breaks in between. There will be roughly 10-14 schools competing, including local teams like D.C. Everest, Marshfield, and Wisconsin Rapids.  I believe they will try to prioritize girls vs girls if there are matches at their weights but this will be a coed event.Spectator InfoAdmission: Expect a small cash entry fee at the door (usually ~$5/adult).Seating: Bleacher seating is standard; feel free to bring a cushion!Food/Drink: Concessions are usually available, but you can bring your own water and light snacks.We are thrilled to have family support—it always means the world to the kids! If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email or text me.Best regards,Dan!From: Daniel Voetberg <dvoetberg@outlook.com>Sent: Monday, December 22, 2025 12:50 PMTo: Daniel Voetberg <dvoetberg@outlook.com>; Sheryl & Fred Voetberg <fsvoet@gmail.com>; deb engel <debengel125@gmail.com>; Peg DeLapp <pjdelapp@gmail.com>; Jane Engel <pswijane@gmail.com>; Jpdelapp627@gmail.com <Jpdelapp627@gmail.com>; cengel85@gmail.com <cengel85@gmail.com>; gacbac09@hotmail.com <gacbac09@hotmail.com>; julie.m.cass@gmail.com <julie.m.cass@gmail.com>; Shawnd125@gmail.com <Shawnd125@gmail.com>; Tatiana Aguilar <tatiana.aglr@gmail.com>; jamie.marie.christensen@gmail.com <jamie.marie.christensen@gmail.com>Cc: DonaldVoetberg@outlook.com <donaldvoetberg@outlook.com>; BrianVoetberg@outlook.com <brianvoetberg@outlook.com>; Tonya Voetberg <tvoetberg@gmail.com>; tacievoetberg@outlook.com <tacievoetberg@outlook.com>Subject: Voetberg Event Updates (Tacie is Wrestling!?) Hi Family!Tacie has decided she wants to try wrestling on the Stevens Point Girls Junior High Team this winter.

Tacie and Donald’s teams took home first place in their respective meets. While Tacie’s performance in the heat matched some of her previous times in cooler weather (securing fourth overall), she has some strategizing and pacing work to do that could help her shave off a few more seconds. Donald’s effort landed just outside the top 20, a fair bit off his previous best at that course. We’re working to help him recover from a recent illness and fine-tune his diet so he can be at his best for the second half of the season. He placed just outside the top 20 in the boys’ varsity race but is determined to keep grinding it out near Madison this week. With some hot weather expected, we’ll ensure the kids stay well-hydrated for their efforts!Rosholt Invite (Tacie)When: Thursday, October 2, 2025, starting at 4:00 PM (Tacie races at 4:45pm)Where: Rosholt High School Course, 346 W.

Below is a quick recap of their seasons so far, along with key details for each meet to keep you informed.Season Recap So Far!Donald: Donald has shown consistent efforts across a variety of course types this season. We've been working closely with his doctor to optimize his performance, including adjustments to his asthma protocol and vitamins based on recent testing. It's too early to see full results, but we're hopeful these changes will help him breathe easier and perform at his best as he tackles the challenging Meadow Links Golf Course this weekend.Tacie: Tacie is off to a strong start in her XC career with three races so far, finishing high in the overall rankings each time. Her team boasts four incredible young talents with a good shot at the middle school state championships (non-WIAA sanctioned, pending coach enrollment). While she's been running well, she's faced some breathing challenges on hot, muggy days due to asthma. We've consulted her doctor and made adjustments, applying learnings from Donald's regimen including vitamins and supplements. She'll have a full workup with blood work in a couple weeks to ensure she's in top shape as she begins her young running career. She will race in the Middle School Girls event at Oshkosh.Meet DetailsManitowoc Meet (Donald)Location: Meadow Links Golf Course, 1540 Johnston Dr, Manitowoc, WI 54220Race Schedule:9:30 a.m.: Junior High Race10:00 a.m.: Junior Varsity Race11:10 a.m.: Varsity Race (Donald's race, the 3rd of the day)12:30 p.m.: Awards CeremonyNotes: Results will likely be posted on the host’s athletic website or ADE Sports timing website.Oshkosh Lourdes Home Invitational (Tacie)Location: XC Ranch, 4647 County Rd S, Oshkosh, WI 54904Spectator Parking: $10 per carload; no offsite parking or course access from offsite.  (See link below for more details)Event Schedule:9:45 a.m.: Varsity/JV Boys Race10:30 a.m.: Varsity/JV Girls Race11:15 a.m.: Middle School Boys Race (1.5 miles)11:45 a.m.: Middle School Girls Race (1.5 miles, Tacie's race, the 4th of the day)12:15 p.m.: Awards CeremonyNotes: Results will be posted on the Lourdes Academy athletic website or ADE Sports timing website.

I wanted to share some thrilling highlights from last week's Neenah Invite—it was a fantastic showcase of talent from our Stevens Point runners!Varsity Boys Shine BrightThe Stevens Point Varsity Boys delivered a stunning performance, outrunning the pre-season #1 ranked team, Marquette University High School from Milwaukee. Donald ran a solid 16:50, though it wasn’t his personal best at this course. The exciting part? His watch data revealed his heart rate decreased during the race, suggesting he’s got untapped potential. We’re planning to work with coaches and drs to analyze this and help him hit his stride. Stay tuned for his progress!Middle School Girls Steal the ShowThe Stevens Point Middle School girls were the talk of the meet! Neenah and Seymour were expected to battle for the top spot, but our girls dominated with five of the top six finishers, earning a near-perfect team score. Even more impressive? The top four were all 7th graders! Tacie had a standout performance, finishing 3rd on her team and setting a personal best in the 2400m with a blazing 6:18 per mile pace. With such depth in talent, this Class of 2031 could be one for the history books. Tacie’s focused on steady training to keep chipping away at her times, with her eyes set on a college running future. The road is long, but she’s off to an incredible start!Results & RankingsCheck out the full results from the Neenah Invite here: Neenah Invite Results.Also, take a peek at the WI Top 20 ranked female middle school runners going into Week 2—our Stevens Point girls are making waves! If they keep up this momentum, they could help the high school girls’ team make a big comeback in the coming years.Next Up: Standing Rocks MeetMark your calendars for this Saturday at 9:00 AM at Standing Rocks County Park in Stevens Point. You can plug this into Google Maps for easy navigation: Speckmann Dog Park, 7201-7727 Standing Rocks Rd, Stevens Point, WI 54482.Tacie’s race is likely to kick off around 9:00 AM, with Donald and the varsity boys expected closer to 11:00 AM. I’ll share more details as soon as I have them.Thanks for cheering on our runners!
